## Windows Instructions
### Install Python 3.7
You can install Python 3.7 [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0.exe)
Add the `python` command to your PATH variable.
	- Open the `Environment Variables` window. On Windows 10 you can do this by searching `edit environment variables for your account` in the Start menu.
	- Edit the `Path` variable either for your User or the System.
	- Add the full path to the folder containing `python.exe` to the beginning of your `Path` variable. For example, mine was located at `C:\Users\Scott\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32`.
	- Confirm your changes. 
	- Open up Command Prompt (`cmd` in Start menu) and type `python`. You should be in a Python shell. **Note: You may need to restart your computer for these changes to be recognized**
